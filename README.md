# Minfei Fei
#### I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. R Vasant Kumar](https://www.mcg.msm.cam.ac.uk/people/AS/dr-vasant-kumar), [Prof. Cate Ducati](https://www.emg.msm.cam.ac.uk/People/cd251) and [Prof. Manish Chhowalla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4XsuGh4AAAAJ). Before that, I received my Master's degree from Rice University with [Prof. Pulickel Ajayan](https://ajayan.rice.edu/pulickel-ajayan.html), ranked top in class of 2019 cohort. I obtained my Bachelor's degree with Outstanding Graduate Award (~Summa Cum Laude) from Nanjing University, working with [Prof. Jianguo Liu](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/intl/3d/7f/c34798a474495/page.htm) and [Prof. Peng Wang](https://wangstem.com/). I was an Undergraduate Visiting Researcher at DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, working under an EMSL User Proposal with [Dr. Scott Chambers](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=5554), [Dr. Chongmin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0568hsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Ph.D. student [Yang He](http://mse.ustb.edu.cn/shiziduiwu/shiziduiwu/cailiaoxuexi/2020-05-25/248.html) (now Professor at USTB).

#### Recently, I am also working closely with [Prof. Jia Zhu](https://nanoenergy.nju.edu.cn/) (NJU), [Prof. Guoran Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VP00V08AAAAJ) (Nankai) and Dr. Kai Xi (Now Professor at Xi'an Jiao Tong U.).
